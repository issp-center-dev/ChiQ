Reporting issues
================

Please report all problems and bugs directly at the github issue page
`<https://github.com/issp-center-dev/ChiQ/issues>`_.
In order to make it easier for us to solve the issue, please follow these guidelines:

#. In all cases specify which version of the software you are using, ChiQ and DCore.
   You can find the version number in the file :file:`README.md` at the root of the application sources.

#. If you have a problem during the installation, give us information about
   your operating system and the compiler you are using. Include the outputs of
   the ``cmake`` and ``make`` commands as well as the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file
   which is in the build directory.

#. If you are experiencing a problem during the execution of the application, provide
   a script which allows to quickly reproduce the problem.

Thanks!
